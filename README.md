# FA-I-sensor
Sketch for interfacing Robotic Materials' FA-I tactile sensor and sensing arrays. You will need a copy of the Arduino IDE and
any compatible Arduino device that supports I2C, 3.3V and 5V. If you have ordered the evaluation kit with a Teensy LC, you will need to install Teensyduino from https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html.

Connect the Arduino/Teensy to your serial port and launch the serial plotter from the Arduino IDE. You should see something like this:
